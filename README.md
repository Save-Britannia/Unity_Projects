# Unity Projects

Community map projects and base terrain scenes for Ultima games. Please contribute PRs!

Only individual file sizes under 1GB. No paid assets or licenses that prevent source versions from being distributed may be included in pull requests if the are to be accepted. Only base map terrain scene data should be submitted presently, although please open an issue and we'd love to talk to you about other editors or ideas for maps and public Ultima-themed assets.

Only public assets, those whose license allows their distribution under the MIT license below or with proper attribution if the license does allow for, are permitted within this public repository. Supplying artwork and texture replacements for the base maps that you are the original author of is highly encouraged and we are happy to accept your help!

Please strip any custom Unity packages or assets before uploading map scenes. In the future, we will see what can be done for more customized scenes with other public assets in them. For now, we are focused on being a public resource for map data to get invdiduals and teams started on projects within the free Unity editor much more quickly.

TODO:
- Add some documentation for SpacialOS and Ataavism back-ends that could be enabled to get Multiplayer started.
